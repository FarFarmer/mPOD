# mPOD
Matlab script to calculate proper orthogonal decomposition using mPOD approach

The main file is mPOD.m.
The file run.m runs several simple test cases.
run.m calls generate_snaps.m to create snapshot data.

The algorithm is described in a paper that is under submission to the AIAA journal.  When that paper is accepted I will put a reference to it here.
